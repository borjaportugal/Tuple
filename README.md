# Tuple

This project contains an implementation of a tuple with a similar functionality to std::tuple.
This is a simple project to have a bit of fun. 


# Testing

What is the [testing](testing) folder? Appart from the tuple I wanted to develop a simple interface to be able to program this small projects using Test Driven Programming, something lightweight for simple projects like this.
